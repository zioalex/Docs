Tricky topics for me:

- See Ebstalk .ebextensions dir usage how to install additional package or custom configs in EBS
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions.html

You can add AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration files (.ebextensions) to your web application's source code to configure your environment and customize the AWS resources that it contains. Configuration files are YAML- or JSON-formatted documents with a .config file extension that you place in a folder named .ebextensions and deploy in your application source bundle.

We recommend using YAML for your configuration files, because it's more readable than JSON. YAML supports comments, multi-line commands, several alternatives for using quotes, and more. However, you can make any configuration change in Elastic Beanstalk configuration files identically using either YAML or JSON.
